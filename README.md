### DESCRIPTION

beat4sprite is a **library** to draw different things in the SM5 engine
inspired on the classic DDR PSX backgrounds and sprite animations.

### HOW TO USE

  1. Drop the beat4sprite folder into the Modules folder of _fallback.
  2. Load the beat4sprite.lua module in OutFox. ( LoadModule("beat4sprite/beat4sprite.lua") in the initial screen )

### ORIGIN

beat4sprite began as a personal project in 2013. 
I used to play with simple BGAnimations or RandomMovies ( Gameplay backgrounds ) on StepMania 3.9, mostly stuff from DDR or ITG.
I was interested in the structure of the sprites and how the game read them.

I got inspired and I wanted to use the retro PSX animations so I tried making videos of them and that didn't blend that well with the song beat.

Then I considered video encoding, quality and file size not being the best so I moved to scripting and writing code (visually scripting) so I could draw 
my own animations.

Examples made with this library can be found in my profile.
For more information about the API check the Wiki.
