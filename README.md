### DESCRIPTION

beat4sprite is a **library** to draw different things in the SM5 engine
inspired on the classic DDR PSX backgrounds and sprite animations.

This is a personal project I began back in 2013, back when 
I used to play with cheap and simple BGAnimations or 
RandomMovies (Gameplay backgrounds) on StepMania 3.9. 
Mostly stuff from DDR or ITG. So around that time 
I started to create my custom videos to use while on gameplay.

Then my idea changed because of video encoding, quality and 
size mostly. I moved to scripting and writing code so I could draw 
my own BGAnimations. So while I was learning Lua through SM and other games
this project evolved.

I tried to do a lot of code maintenance and debugging too, 
checking my code and performance testing in-game.
